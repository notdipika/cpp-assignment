// Create a base class Account with data members accountNumber and balance. Derive two classes Savings Account and CheckingAccount from Account. Implement polymorphic behavior where the base class pointer can point to objects of derived classes, and call their respective member functions to deposit and withdraw money, applying specific rules for each account type.
